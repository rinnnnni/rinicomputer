**This website is not a portfolio** or an instrument for self-promotion; it is not finished and will never be.

This space is a garden where I grow thoughts and ideas on things I'm currently learning and exploring; subjects may be (very) technical or just pure daydreams. I'm constantly evolving and changing my mind, nothing here is permanent. 

Here, I learn and fail in the open. I embrace and show my vulnerabilities just like I do when I fall in love. **This garden is a love letter for me**, for those who will eventually read this note, and for the better web I dream about. 

*"A website is an act of demanding space for yourself and the people you love and constantly tending that space. It's a way of naming: to take on a URL and courageously ask to be witnessed, visited. I understand certain sites that I frequent as continuous labors of love, whether they're directed to a specific person or something broader. I see making websites and making in general as nothing more than a way of asking to be loved."*

I wrote this intro heavily inspired by laurel schwulst's beautiful piece ["My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?"](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shi)
