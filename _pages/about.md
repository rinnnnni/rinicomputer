This place is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) where I share my discoveries and explorations on a variety of subjects, both technical and imaginative. This is a space where I keep some personal notes, musings, and creative projects (finished or unfinished). I'm constantly evolving and changing my mind, so nothing here is set in stone.  

I am heavily inspired by Laurel Schwulst's beautiful piece ["My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?"](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)

Hi! I'm Marcella, and i go by Rini online.

I hold a bachelor's degree in **Design** and I am currently attending postgraduate studies in **Cybersecurity**.
            
During office hours, i work as a UI developer at the Recife Center for Advanced Studies and Systems, which is one of the most renowed innovation centers in Brazil.
            
I draw Inspiration from topics such as calm technology, computing as poetry, how people and computers interact, low tech, looking for answers in nature, and much more.
            
I'm obsessed with music; Ambient, shoegaze and post-rock are my favorite genres.
            
My favorite type of food is seafood and my favorite drink is white wine.
            
I can see the sea from my window.

I was born during a lunar eclipse.
            
I flourish in the small hours.
